A/B Testing Procedure

1.  Problem Statement
    What is the goal of the experiment

2. Hypothesis Testing
    What results do you hypothesize from the experiment?

3. Design the Experiment
    What are your experiment parameters?

4. Run the Experiment
    What are the requirements for running an experiment?

5. Validity Check
    Did the experiment run soundly without errors or bias?

6 Interpret results
    In which direction is the metric significant statistically and practically?

7. Launch Decision
    Based on the results and trade-offs, should the change launch?

################## EXAMPLE PROBLEM ##############################

1. Suppose that an online clothing store called FashinWebStore wants to Test
a new ranking algo to provide products more relevant to customers. How would you Design
the experiment?

STEPS:
1. Problem Statement
 - Talk about the Business goal first
 - User journey
    - Understand how users interact with our website or products
    - Product experience we are trying to change
    EX
        - User -> Searcher an item -> Browse items -> Views and item -> Purchase
    Why is this important?
        - At what stage is the user a participant in the experiment?
        - MUST DO - Visit the platform and create an outline

    SUCCESS METRIC 
        - What do we need to move or change to determine if it is successful?
            1. Measurable
                - Can the behavior be tracked using the data you collected from users?
            2. Attributable
                - Can you assign the behavior (effect) to the treatment (cause)? Does it explain the causal effect?
            3. Sensitive
                - Does the metric have low variability that you can distinguish the treatment from control?
            4. Timely
                - Can you measure the success behavior in the short term?
            5. Revenue Per DAY Per User

2. Hypothesis Testing
    a. Setting up the Test
        - Null Hypothesis: The average revenue per day per user between the baseline and variant ranking algorithms are the Statement
        - Alternative Hypothesis: The average revenue per day per user between the baseline and variant ranking algorithms are different.
    b. Set the significance level
        - alpha value 0.5
        - decision threshold
        - P(type 1 error)
    c. Set the statistical power
        - statistical power: 0.80
        - The probability of detecting an effect if the alternative Hypothesis is true
    d. Set the minimum detectable effect (MDE)
        - if the change is at least 1% higher in revenue per day per user then it is practically significant
        
3. Design the Experiment
    a. Set the randomization unit
        - Randamizaton unit: User
    b. Target population in the experiment
        - Users: Visitors who search for product
        - User experience in the experiment, what level?
        - Ex. Once they searched for a product
    c. Determine the sample size
        - n = 16 variance/delta where delta is the difference between the treatment and the control.
    d. Duration of experiment
        - 1-2 weeks
        - day of the week affect
4. Run the Experiment
    a. Set up instruments and data pipelines to collect data
    b. Avoid peeking p-values as it can

5. Validity Checks
    a. Checks for bugs, glitches
    b. External factors: Holidays, competition, economic disruptions
    c. Selection Bias: Homogeneous run an A/A Test
        - Compare the identical experience on a different random set of users
    d. Sample Ratio Mismatch: Chi-square Goodness of Fit Test
    e. Novelty Effect: Segment by new and old Visitors
        - detection: Segment by new and old visitors. If there is a change then there is a presence of Novelty effect.
6. Interpret results
    a. Is the success metric statistically significant vs practically
    b. Confidence interval
    c. Reject the null Hypothesis
7. Launch the experiment
    a. Metric Trade-offs:
        - Primary metrics may improve but secondary metrics may decline
    b. Cost of launching
        - Launching and maintaining the change across the users might be costly
    c. False Positive:
